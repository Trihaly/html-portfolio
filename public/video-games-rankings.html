<h1>My Favorite Video Games</h1>

<h2>Mass Effect Trilogy</h2>
<p>This is a great RPG game. It takes place in the future. Humanity finally took to the stars to discover the universe is already populated with many intelligent races who have their own government and laws.</p>
<p>What makes this game so great is the realism and complexity of the supporting cast. Your companions have their own wants and needs. Their goals. Their story. They feel like real people and friends. You easily get attahed to them and what happens to them affects you in real life.</p>
<h2>Genshin Impact</h2>
<p>This is a fairly new game. It's been out for about 3 years, but I only started playing it last year.</p>
<p>What makes this game great is the diverse cast of characters and the multiple ways you can mix and match your party to create something anyone can enjoy.</p>
<p>The story, especially in the newer quests, is also incredibly complex and well written. The intrigue is some of the best I've seen in a long time, and it kept me guessing and trying to figure out the mysteries.</p>
<p>I am looking forwawrd to what this game has to offer in the future.</p>
<h2>Super Mario World</h2>
<p>This is an older one, but it is the very first game on a console that I owned. It was also the only one for many years, so I ended up playing it so much that I was able to do several of the levels blindfolded.</p>
<p>I have so many great memories associated with this game, and to this day, hearing the music from the levels or seeing someone play through them, brings me back to when I was a child and immediately brings a smile to my face.</p>
